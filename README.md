# JupyterLite Demonstrating PubMed_Central_ID_Converter_for_humans

[![lite-badge](https://jupyterlite.rtfd.io/en/latest/_static/badge.svg)](https://fomightez.github.io/lite_PMC_Converter4Humans/lab/index.html?fromURL=https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fomightez/PubMed_Central_ID_Converter_for_humans/refs/heads/main/notebooks/jupyterlite_demo.ipynb)

JupyterLite offering for demonstrating the package PubMed_Central_ID_Converter_for_humans, which is  simple library for using the PubMed Central ID Convert API for biomedical and scientific literature in modern Python/Jupyter ecosystems.  
See [my PubMed_Central_ID_Converter_for_humans repo](https://github.com/fomightez/PubMed_Central_ID_Converter_for_humans) for more information about the package featured in the demonstration.

JupyterLite, while still having some rough edges allows more privac & addressing security concerns than MyBinder because the compute and edited notebooks stay on the local machine. Since this package looks up things on public databases, it probably isn't much a concern for this package; however, it being in JupyterLite may more easily allow it to work in more secure/private situations upstream or downstream in a workflow.

See [my PubMed_Central_ID_Converter_for_humans repo](https://github.com/fomightez/PubMed_Central_ID_Converter_for_humans) for more information about the package featured in the demonstration.  

The notebook featured in this demonstration is actually stored [there](https://github.com/fomightez/PubMed_Central_ID_Converter_for_humans/tree/main/notebooks). It is loaded at the startup using [the extension jupyterlab-open-url-parameter](https://github.com/jupyterlab-contrib/jupyterlab-open-url-parameter). This allows the content to be separate from the JupyterLite deployment repo. I'm keeping the pre-installed packages sparse in the deployment so that the demo can cover working in a wider range of JupyterLite situations and be more easily updatable. JupyterLite being newer I figured it was probably better to keep the situation simpler.
